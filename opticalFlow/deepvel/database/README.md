- Run imax.py to convolve all images and velocities with the IMaX PSF+some remaining atmosphere. This
  generates files
   * /scratch1/aasensio/deepLearning/opticalFlow/database/int_imax_degraded.h5
   * /scratch1/aasensio/deepLearning/opticalFlow/database/vel_imax_degraded.h5

- Run normalize.py to generate a file with the normalization of the intensity and velocity images
